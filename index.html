    <section id="gateI">
      <h2>Gate I – Entry</h2>
      <p>We enter this plane innocent and pure,<br>
as the mosh pit of manifestation entangles the soul,<br>
we forget that of which we came; by design so we claim.<br>
The journey faced is multi-spacial,<br>
not gender not even racial.<br>
Through the spindles of time, we're sure to find,<br>
the answers have never been far behind.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="gateII">
      <h2>Gate II – The Ascension Stirring</h2>
      <p>my body projects upward, I’m no longer asleep;<br>
what is real and what is dreamed fuse in me.<br>
An uncanny feeling riddles my bones,<br>
as I brush the sweat the feeling grows.<br>
The meaning claws at my circuits,<br>
only to blow fuses and grow confusion.<br>
Visions appear, as if holding up a mirror;<br>
suddenly everything is clear.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="gateIII">
      <h2>Gate III – Cosmic Breath</h2>
      <p>It began with an inhale,<br>
the exhale poured vibrations across the cosmos.<br>
Cupping infinity omnidirectionally,<br>
the source of all tension begins to create.<br>
Resonance sculpts the universes,<br>
galaxies spiral into perfection—<br>
man takes his first breath.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="gateIV">
      <h2>Gate IV – The Tongue of Silence</h2>
      <p>Such words expand desire, while others hinder it.<br>
To know the difference is to be the one;<br>
for the souls under the sun speak in a different tongue.<br>
Time created this barrier, it rests upon us to remember<br>
for the key to unity, lies in the embers.<br><br>
As words dwindle in space, resonance takes its place<br>
Those who gain access are damned and doomed alike<br>
For the mortal soul created language as a personal strike.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="gateV">
      <h2>Gate V – The Return to Flame</h2>
      <p>As truth embeds the mind, the body feels divine<br>
The lips remain sealed, for the ears of wisdom are not here.<br>
Observing a world in dismay, crippled by the things one could say.<br>
They continue inward as the noise begins to fade.<br><br>
Reunited with silence, they forget the noise and violence.<br>
To feel the power within, is to be united with him.</p>
